# Diamond Dynasty Player Generator

This player generator application is created for use with Diamond Dynasty, a career mode/GM baseball game for the tabletop. The game focuses on team and roster building rather than the traditional game decisions and strategies. There is a full financial system with upgrades to team staff, stadiums, and more that will boost revenue and give gamers alternative pathways to building a team (rather than just winning games).

To use the player generator, open the application on any web-enabled device. Click the "Generate Player" button to create new free agents or players to seed a new team. To create rookies for the Draft phase click the button labeld "Generate Rookie." Rookies have some special constraints for assigning skill levels.
